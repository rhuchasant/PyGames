# PyGames
This is our prototype of PyGame. We used an inspiration of Flappy Bird Game and tried making something similar using Python libraries.
Finding Py is a simple, non-complex and user-friendly PyGame. We used various Python libraries to do so. We went for a revamp of a nostalgic idea of a game- Flappy Bird instead of going for a completely unique idea which will be difficult to comprehend for a new user.
